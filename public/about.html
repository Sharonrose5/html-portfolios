<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Sharon rose and I'm 21 years old with strong determination and passion for learning new everyday.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm all about coding, especially web development. After finishing my degree (yes, with a couple of arrears—it’s part of the journey!), I found a real passion for creating and building on the web. I’m currently diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Every day, I get more fascinated by how these elements come together to create dynamic, interactive websites.

  Each new concept feels like a mini-challenge that pushes me further. I’m constantly working on small projects, learning from mistakes, debugging, and making things look and work better. My favorite part? Seeing the ideas I have in my mind come to life on the screen. I love how coding lets me think creatively and logically at the same time.
  
  I know there’s a lot more to learn, but that’s what keeps me excited. I’m here for the late-night problem-solving, the debugging, and the feeling of satisfaction when everything finally works!
